# **Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope?**

In Python, a variable defined inside a function is called a local variable. It can only be accessed within that function or scope. On the other hand, a variable defined outside a function (or in the global scope) is called a global variable. It can be accessed by any function or scope in the program.It's important to note that if a local variable has the same name as a global variable, the local variable will take precedence within its scope.Global is used to access and modify global variables from within a function, while nonlocal is used to access and modify variables from the nearest enclosing scope that is not global.

## **How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?**

***The "global" keyword in Python is used to declare a variable inside a function as a global variable, meaning it can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program. The "nonlocal" keyword is used to declare a variable inside a nested function as nonlocal, meaning it can be accessed and modified from within the nested function and its parent function.***

***You might use the "global" keyword when you need to modify a variable that is defined outside of a function from within the function. You might use the "nonlocal" keyword when you have a nested function and need to modify a variable defined in the parent function, but not in the global scope. It is generally recommended to use these keywords sparingly, as they can make code harder to read and debug.***

## **In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis?**

1. Big O notation is a way of describing the performance of an algorithm by analyzing how its runtime or space requirements scale with the size of the input. It is used to understand and compare the efficiency of different algorithms and to predict how they will perform on large inputs.
2. The importance of Big O notation lies in its ability to help programmers choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem. By analyzing the time or space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation,
