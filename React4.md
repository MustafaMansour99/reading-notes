# Dynamic Routes vs. Static Routes in Next.js
## Dynamic Routes
***Dynamic routes in Next.js allow the creation of pages with variable URLs based on data. These routes use square brackets [] in the filename within the pages directory. The content for dynamic routes is generated at runtime, allowing for pages that can handle varying content based on provided variables in the URL. This makes dynamic routes suitable for cases where content changes frequently or depends on user input.***

## Static Routes
***Static routes in Next.js refer to pages with fixed URLs and content at build time. These routes are suitable for pages that don't change frequently and have content that remains the same until the next build. The content for static routes is generated during the build process and doesn't depend on external data or user input.***

### In summary, Next.js supports two types of routes: dynamic and static. Dynamic routes use variable URLs generated at runtime and are suitable for content that changes frequently or depends on user input. Static routes have fixed URLs and content generated at build time, making them suitable for pages with unchanging content. By leveraging dynamic and static routes, developers can create flexible and interactive web applications that cater to various use cases.

# Deploying a Next.js Application
## Deploying a Next.js application involves several key steps to ensure your application is accessible to users on the internet

## Key Steps for Deploying a Next.js Application:
1. Preparing the Application: Before deployment, ensure that your Next.js application is fully developed, tested, and ready for production. This includes optimizing the code, assets, and ensuring any environment-specific configurations are set correctly.

2. Version Control: Use a version control system like Git to track changes in your code.

3. Build the Application: In Next.js, run the build command to create a production-ready build of your application.

4. Choose a Hosting Platform: Select a hosting platform that suits your application's requirements.

5. Configure Environment Variables: If your application relies on environment variables, make sure to configure them on the hosting platform

6. Deploy the Application
