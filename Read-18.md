 ## The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions. The basic principle is to replace each letter in the plaintext (message to be encrypted) with a letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, "A" becomes "D," "B" becomes "E," and so on. This shift is typically referred to as the "key." The resulting encrypted message is called the ciphertext. To decrypt the message, the process is reversed by shifting the letters back to their original positions.

 ### ***Historically, Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor, is said to have used this cipher to protect his military communications. It offered a simple and effective way to conceal the content of messages from unauthorized individuals. However, as it is based on a fixed and known shift value, the Caesar Cipher is relatively easy to break using brute-force methods or frequency analysis.***

 # Symmetric Encryption vs. Asymmetric Encryption

 **Symmetric encryption: In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The sender and receiver share the secret key in advance. The main advantage of symmetric encryption is its speed and efficiency, as it typically requires less computational power compared to asymmetric encryption. However, the challenge lies in securely sharing the key between the communicating parties.**

**Asymmetric encryption: Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, uses a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is freely distributed, while the private key is kept secret. Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key, and vice versa. Asymmetric encryption provides a solution to the key distribution problem faced by symmetric encryption. It enables secure communication between parties who have not previously shared a secret key.**

# How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? 

**True Random Number Generators (TRNG): TRNGs generate random numbers based on physical processes or sources of entropy. These sources could include atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, or mouse movements. TRNGs produce numbers that are statistically random and unpredictable. However, they may require specialized hardware to gather entropy and can be slower compared to PRNGs.**

**Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG): PRNGs generate numbers using deterministic algorithms. They start with an initial value called a seed and use mathematical formulas to generate a sequence of numbers that appear random. PRNGs are fast and easy to implement in software. However, since they are deterministic, if the same seed is used, the same sequence of numbers will be generated, making them predictable.**

# Encryption vs. Decryption

**Encryption: Imagine you want to send a secret message to your friend. You place the message inside a locked box. The act of locking the box represents the encryption process. The key to unlock the box is known only to your friend, who will be able to decrypt the message.**

**Decryption: Your friend receives the locked box and uses the key to unlock it. Unlocking the box represents the decryption process. Once the box is unlocked, your friend can retrieve the original message, which was the plaintext.**
