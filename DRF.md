## Django Rest Framework (DRF) Permissions

Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions are a key component of the Django framework for building RESTful APIs. Their purpose is to provide a mechanism for controlling access and securing the API endpoints.

DRF permissions allow you to define who can perform specific actions on the API resources, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data. They help in securing an API by enforcing authentication, authorization, and other access control mechanisms.

## SQL SELECT Statement

In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. Its purpose is to query the database and return a result set that matches specific conditions.

To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would use the following SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
