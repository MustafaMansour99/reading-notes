# Difference Between Class and Object in OOPs

## What is Class?

A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object. It provides initial values for member variables and member functions or methods

## What is Object?

An object is nothing but a self-contained component that consists of methods and properties to make a data useful. It helps you to determines the behavior of the class.

For example, when you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.

From a programming point of view, an object can be a data structure, a variable, or a function that has a memory location allocated. The object is designed as class hierarchies.

|    A class does not allocate memory space when it is created.     | Object allocates memory space whenever they are created. |
| Classes can’t be manipulated as they are not available in memory. |                 They can be manipulated.                 |
|                 You can declare class only once.                  |   TYou can create more than one object using a class.    |

# Recursion 

***Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. The article begins by explaining the basic structure of a recursive function, and goes on to provide several examples of how recursion can be used to solve problems such as computing factorials and searching through directories. The article also covers some important considerations when using recursion, including base cases, stack overflow, and tail recursion optimization. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive introduction to recursion in Python and demonstrates how it can be used to solve a variety of problems.***
