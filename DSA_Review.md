# From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

***Plan and communicate your approach: Before diving into coding, take a few moments to plan your approach. Break down the problem into smaller components, identify the key steps, and outline a high-level solution. This planning phase helps you organize your thoughts and ensures that you have a clear direction. Additionally, don't forget to communicate your approach with the interviewer. Explaining your thought process and solution strategy can demonstrate your problem-solving abilities and effectively engage with the interviewer throughout the interview,Write clean and readable code: When writing code on the whiteboard, focus on producing clean and readable code. This includes using consistent indentation, proper variable names, and clear comments where necessary. Avoid cluttering the code with unnecessary complexity or clever optimizations that can make it harder to understand. Writing clean code not only helps the interviewer follow your thought process but also showcases your attention to detail, professionalism, and ability to produce maintainable code.***
