## Stack and Queue are two commonly used data structures in computer science.

**A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are often used for function calls, undo operations, and expressions evaluation.**

**A queue, on the other hand, is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front. Queues are often used for managing tasks or events that need to be processed in the order they were received.**

***In summary, both stack and queue are data structures that store elements, but the main difference is in the way elements are added and removed. Stacks are LIFO, where the last element added is the first to be removed, while queues are FIFO, where the first element added is the first to be removed.***
