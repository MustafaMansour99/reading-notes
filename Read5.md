# LINKED-LIST

## A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes that are connected to each other through pointers. Each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the list.

## Linked lists offer several advantages over arrays, including dynamic size, efficient insertion and deletion, and flexibility. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as slower access time and the need for more memory due to the storage of pointers.

## ***There are several types of linked lists, including*** **singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists**. Singly linked lists have nodes that only point to the next node, while doubly linked lists have nodes that point to both the next and previous nodes. Circular linked lists have a last node that points back to the first node, creating a circular structure.

## Some common operations on linked lists include 
1. adding nodes in first or last or mid
2. deleting nodes
3. searching for a specific node
3. and traversing the list.

## Overall, linked lists are an important data structure in computer science that offer a flexible and efficient way to store and manipulate data.
