**1. Purpose and Working of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) is to securely transmit information between two parties in a compact and self-contained manner. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.

- **Working**: JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing. The payload contains the claims or information being transmitted. The signature is created by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret key known only to the server.

  The process of encoding and decoding data in JWTs involves the following steps:
  1. The server creates a token by encoding the header and payload as a JSON object, and then signing it using the secret key.
  2. The server sends the JWT to the client, typically as part of an authentication response.
  3. The client includes the JWT in subsequent requests, typically in the `Authorization` header.
  4. The server validates the JWT by decoding it using the secret key, verifying the signature, and checking the claims for validity and authorization.

**2. JWT Authentication with Django REST Framework**

To integrate JWT authentication with Django REST Framework (DRF) and secure API endpoints, the following key components are involved:

- **Authentication Backend**: DRF provides an authentication backend called `JWTAuthentication`. This backend verifies and authenticates JWTs received from clients.

- **Token Generation**: When a user successfully logs in, a JWT needs to be generated and returned to the client. This can be done using a library like `pyjwt` to create and sign the JWT.

- **Token Verification**: Before allowing access to protected API endpoints, the server verifies the JWT sent by the client. This involves decoding the JWT and checking the signature and expiration time.

- **Setting Authentication Classes**: In DRF's settings, you need to include the `JWTAuthentication` backend as one of the authentication classes. This ensures that the JWT authentication backend is used for securing the API endpoints.

**3. Django's `runserver` and Alternative Server Options**

The built-in `runserver` command provided by Django is not suitable for production environments due to several reasons:

- **Performance**: The `runserver` command is single-threaded and not optimized for high traffic or production-level loads. It is intended for development purposes only.

- **Security**: The `runserver` command is not designed to handle security concerns typically required in production environments, such as SSL/TLS encryption, load balancing, or fine-grained access control.

- **Stability and Monitoring**: The `runserver` command lacks features for process management, monitoring, and automatic restarts in case of failures.

For deploying a Django application in a production environment, it is recommended to consider alternative server options such as:

- **Gunicorn**: Gunicorn is a widely used Python web server that can handle multiple concurrent requests. It provides performance benefits and can be easily integrated with Django.

- **uWSGI**: uWSGI is another popular server option that offers high performance and supports various deployment scenarios. It can be used as a standalone server or integrated with other web servers like Nginx.

- **Docker and Kubernetes**: Containerization tools like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes can be used to deploy Django applications in a scalable and manageable manner, allowing for easy scaling, monitoring, and deployment management.
