## Test Coverage

**Test coverage is a measure of how much of a software system is tested by a particular set of tests. The article explains that test coverage is not a guarantee of software quality, as it is possible to have high test coverage but still miss important defects. However, it is an important metric to measure the effectiveness of testing efforts and to identify areas where testing may need to be improved. The article describes different types of test coverage, including statement coverage, branch coverage, and path coverage, and explains how each can be useful in different situations. The author also discusses some limitations of test coverage and suggests that it should be used in combination with other testing techniques to ensure software quality. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of test coverage and its role in software testing.**
